# READ ME

## I made the design look like the image/gif provide in the module 2 challenge. I did this by creating elements, importing images, I've also added media queries in order for text and sizes of elements to change with the page size. I added anchor tags and links which target id selectors to navigate to a section when clicked.

## GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
## WHEN I load their portfolio
## THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and ## links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
## WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
## THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
## WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
## THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
## WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
## THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
## WHEN I click on the images of the applications
## THEN I am taken to that deployed application
## WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
## THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
